# Hexwar

This project is unfinished and put on pause.

Hexwar is a territorial game based on a freeware game I don't remember the name of which I got to play sometimes in the 90s. The field is an arrangement of hexagons of various colors. Your start tile can change color and all adjacent tiles of the same color will also change their color, creating a cascade that gets bigger each turn. Whoever has secured the most territory at the end wins.

The game features a basic AI that optimizes the number of gains for the next turn only.
